# Introduction

- Multi-paradigm language (Procedural, Object-Oriented, Functional)
- Backward compatible (not forward compatible)
- Implementation of the ECMAScript standard (TC39 Committee)
- Core technology of the Web

<Notes>

- Multi-paradigm -> choice is on a programmer, the mix of concepts from multiple paradigms
- Backward compatible -> old code can run on newer versions
- Forward compatible -> new code can run on older versions (We need tools to [**transpile**](https://babeljs.io/) new code for the older platforms)
- TC39 -> committee responsible for ECMA standards -> Major companies (Google, Apple), device manufacturers (Samsung), etc.

# History - 1994.

- Web pages are booming
- Netscape Navigator is the most popular web browser
- Pages are static -> people want dynamic pages

---

# History - 1995.

- Companies tried embedding Java into browsers -> <span style={{ color: "red" }}>FAIL</span>
- [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) created LiveScript
- LiveScript shipped as JavaScript in Netscape Navigator -> <span style={{ color: "green" }}>SUCCESS</span>
- Microsoft IE uses JScript -> reverse engineered JavaScript

<Notes>

- JavaScript name was a marketing trick designed to attract Java programmers, Java is hot at the time
- Today Oracle owns the "JavaScript" trademark but doesn't enforce it. That is the reason why official name of the language is ECMAScript, but people use JavaScript.
- JScript -> reverse engineering discovered JavaScript bugs and quirks which were also copied in JScript

</Notes>

---

# History - Rest

- ECMA standardization (1996.)
- Microsoft IE has 95% market cap -> standardized bugs from JScript
- Mozilla Firefox (2004.)
- Ajax (2005.)
- Google Chrome (2008.)
- Major improvements:
  - ECMA2009 (ES5)
  - ECMA2015 (ES6)

<Notes>

- standardized bugs which are in language to this date (e.g. type of `null` is object)
- AJAX -> set of tecnologies to load and display web data in background (Asynchronous)
- Chrome -> JIT Compilation (significant speedup)
- [ES5](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es5.asp) -> strict mode, array methods, JSON methods, ...
- [ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) -> arrow functions, classes, `let`, `const`, ...
- Latest JS specification today is ES2020 (ES11) -> yearly relase plan

</Notes>

# JavaScript engine

- Key part of a browser
- Runs JavaScript code
  - compile
  - optimize
- V8 (Chrome & Node & Edge), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), Nitro (Safari)

<Notes>

Two key functions of an engine:

- compile -> JIT compilation was game changer in 2008. -> now all browsers implement JIT compiler
- optimize -> Code optimization -> [More on V8 optimizations](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-javascript-works-optimizing-the-v8-compiler-for-efficiency/)

# JavaScript Basics

- C like syntax (`if`, `switch`, `while`)
- Dynamically typed
- Types (`typeof` operator):
  - primitive: `number`, `boolean`, `string`, `undefined`
  - complex: `object`, `null`, `function`
- Variables:
  - `var` -> function scope, reassignable
  - `let` -> block scope, reassignable
  - `const` -> block scope, cannot be reassigned

<Notes>

- Dynamically typed - types are used internally by the engine, the variable type is determined in runtime.
- Falsy values (false, 0, `''`, `null`, `undefined`
- There is no separate `Array` type (it's `Object`)
- `null` is separate type, which resolves to `Object` (JS bug)
- `var` is global when used outside the function
- `let` and `const` came with ES2015 and are commonly used

</Notes>

# Example - Hello World

```js
console.log('Hello World')
```

</Invert>

<Notes>

- `console.log()` function is not specified in ECMA specification -> developers use utility functions of the desired platform (e.g. all browsers have console.log implementation, event Node has one).
  Browsers expose the `window` top-level object which contains the `console.log` function. Node has the `global` top-level object with utility functions. The general rule is that platform top-level objects can be omitted (use `console.log()` instead of `window.console.log()`).
  Please note that each top-level object has its' utilities, so calling a non-existent function will result in an error.
- Where are `;` -> JS has automatic semicolon injection (ASI), so if you miss one it will be inserted and the code will run.
  ASI will try to add a semicolon after line terminator (`\n`), block ending bracket (`}`), end of the file, specific grammar places (after `return`, `break`, ...).
  A semicolon will be inserted only if the line is incorrect without a semicolon. If the line has no errors and the next line also follows JS grammar then the semicolon will not be inserted.

</Notes>

# Example - ASI

<img className="big-image" alt="Asi example" src={asi} />

</Invert>

<Notes>

- Semicolon here changes evaluation (without semicolon -> lines are merged into one)
- Note ternary operator -> very useful later with React

</Notes>

<Invert>

# Example - Types

```js
typeof 2 // number
typeof 'SFA' // string
typeof { foo: 'bar' } // object
typeof [1, 2, 3] // object -> not array!
typeof (() => {}) // function -> this is arrow function
typeof null // object -> JScript bug!
typeof NaN // number -> Not a number is a number :)
```

</Invert>

# Type Coercion

- Process of converting a value from one type to another
- Happens implicitly (e.g. `==` instead of `===`)

<Notes>

- Double equal checks variables by value -> if types aren't the same then it will coerce values to a common type. [Detailed coercion rules](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/js-type-coercion-explained-27ba3d9a2839/)
- Triple equal won't allow coercion and will return false if types are different, and true only if types and values are the same
- **Always use triple equal** (enforce it if you can)

</Notes>

<Notes>

[Detailed explanation with more memes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/explaining-the-best-javascript-meme-i-have-ever-seen/)

- Fun examples:
  - `0 == {}` => `false`
  - `false == new Boolean(false)` => `true`, but `false === new Boolean(false)` => `false`

</Notes>

<Invert>

# Example - Plus Sign

- Concatenating strings, adding numbers
- If number and string -> coerce number to a string

```js
2 + 4 // 6
'Sofa' + 'Score' // SofaScore
2 + 4 + 'Score' // 6Score
'Sofa' + 2 + 4 // Sofa24
```

</Invert>

---

# Objects

- Most important structure in JavaScript
- Collection of named values
  - values can be of any type (even function)
- **MUTABLE**
- Creation:
  - `new Object`
  - `Object.create`
  - `{ foo: 'bar' }` -> most used

<Notes>

- Functions can be used as a value and stored in variables. This allows some cool patterns such as object methods, encapsulation, ...
- Mutable -> adding or changing the property of an object doesn't change object (its reference stays the same) -> **IMPORTANT for React**
- `Object.create` -> creates new object from existing object if provided as argument -> used for inheritance
- Curly braces (Object literal) are most used for object creation because it results in the cleanest code.

</Notes>

---

# This

- Reference to an object it belongs to
- Used in functions, to access properties of an owner (similar to Java)

```js
const person = {
  firstName: 'Sofa',
  lastName: 'Score',
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + this.lastName // SofaScore
  },
}
```

<Notes>

- Java methods have `this` and `this` is a reference to an instance on which method is called.
  In JavaScript, functions have `this`. If global function is called (without owner), `this` refers to the global object (`window`, `global`)

</Notes>

---

<Invert>

# Example - This or That

</Invert>

---

# Functions

- Can be pictured as `Object`
- Function Declaration
  - `function doSomething() { ... }`
- Function Expression
  - `const doSomething = function() { ... }`
- Arrow functions
  - `const return2021 = () => 2021`
  - `function` and `return` can be avoided
  - no `this`

<Notes>

- Function as objects -> can have properties and methods, even have object prototype (e.g. `console.log insanceof Object` is `true`)
- Two most common ways of function creation, a slight difference is in hoisting (explained later)
- Arrow functions are commonly used, return is often omitted to improve readability. They don't change `this`, so there is no need for `that`.
- IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) -> historically used to provide encapsulation for variables (`var`).
  Code was wrapped in a function that was called after definition, and variables from that code were scoped to function and not visible from the outside.

# Example - Function Arguments

<Notes>

- `call by value` or `call by reference` mode depends on operations performed on arguments inside the function

# Prototype inheritance

- Mechanism by which JS objects inherit features
- Prototype chain -> chain of prototypes for an object (all accessible)
- Most OO languages -> class inheritance

<Notes>

- Prototype chain -> list of inherited prototypes starting from more specific to more general. If an object doesn't have property or function then look in its prototype.
  If a more specific prototype doesn't contain searched property or function, go into the next, more generic prototype, ...
- All prototypes end with object prototype -> "Object is the king in JavaScript"
- `instanceof` operator tests if an object has some prototype in its chain (e.g. function is an instance of an object)

</Notes>

---

import arrayProto from './images/arrayProto.png'

<img className="big-image" alt="Array prototype chain" src={arrayProto} />

<Notes>

- List of all array methods -> useful for later
- Note how array has its own prototype, and then its prototype has object prototype
- `constructor` method is called with `new` keyword

</Notes>

---

<Invert>

# Example - Prototypes

</Invert>

<Notes>

- Note how prototypes and functions make classic inheritance possible, they even extend possibilities (dynamic prototype change)

</Notes>

---

# Classes

- Classes are type of functions in JS
- Cleaner and more familiar syntax
  - `constructor` function
  - `static` methods
  - `extends` and `super`

<Notes>

- Classes are actually functions -> functions are objects -> all classes can be written as objects
- Class syntax is similar to other OO languages (Java)
- Classes can have getters and setters too (`get` and `set` keywords)

</Notes>

---

<Invert>

# Example - Classes

# Hoisting

- Process of moving all **DECLARATIONS** to the top of a file
- Hoisted:
  - Function declarations (`function() {...}`)
  - `var` variables
- Not Hoisted:
  - Function expresions (`const a = () => {}`)
  - `const` and `let` variables
  - classes

---

<Invert>

# Example - Hoisting

```js
x = 'X'

console.log({ x, y }) // { x: 'X', y: undefined }

var x
var y = 'Y'
```

</Invert>

<Notes>

- Declarations are hoisted (`var x`), not definitions (`x = 'X'`)

</Notes>

---

# Closure

- Functions are bundled with references to the surrounding state (Lexical Environment)
- Inner function can access outer function scope **even after** outer function has finished its execution
- Makes encapsulation possible

# Example - Closure
