# TypeScript background 01

- JavaScript is dynamically typed and has "quirky" behaviors
  - These and other features/shortcomings make it easier to make mistakes in JS
- Should JS be replaced as THE language of the web?
  - Bigger undertaking than writing in another language and compiling the code into JS
  - 2009-2010: [CoffeeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript) which compiles into JS
  - 2011: Google [Dart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)) which compiles into JS

---

# TypeScript background 02

- 2012: Microsoft announces TypeScript (TS), a superset of JavaScript
  - Meaning every JS code is valid TS code, but you can write better code
  - With future ES specifications in mind
  - Gradually released, but became a big hit!
  - Complies .ts files into regular .js and **.tsx into .jsx**

---

# TypeScript syntax

- [Four essential cheatsheets](https://www.typescriptlang.org/cheatsheets)
- The gist of TS are TYPES, i.e. only describing values of variables, object properties, etc.
  - [Everyday types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html)
  - TS does add enums as a feature
- We won't go into detail on slides, there will be code examples to check out ðŸ˜Š

---

# TypeScript + React

- Great combination, React is much more expresive with TypeScript
- Types are added as extra modules to existing libraries, they don't have to be re-written
  - See how styled components are installed
- `yarn create react-app app-name --template typescript`
  - Creates a new React project with types
  - `tsconfig.json` file in which you define compiler rules
- your TS code is transpiled into desired version of JS code

# CSS in JS 01

- Classic usage of CSS via classes isn't really for the components era
  - In big projects, those can become mentally unscalable
  - While it supports code reuse, only most basic stuff is re-used
    - E.g. standard project paddings, margins, borders
  - CSS is focused on defining document-level stylesheets, not component-level
  - Solution: CSS in JS

---

# CSS in JS 02

- Idea: Write CSS inside JS files, leverage some JS features
- Advantages:
  - Thinking in components
  - Inject only used styles at render-time, not all styles
  - Handles vendor prefixing (e.g. `-webkit-box-align` or `-moz-box-align`)
  - Dead code elimination
  - Almost flat learning curve because it's very similar to classic CSS, but better
  - No (minimal) inline styling
  - Clean conditional statements

---

# Styled components

- `yarn add styled-components`
- `yarn add @types/styled-components`
- SofaScore's preferred CSS in JS library
- Essentially writing styles inside template strings
  - Allows using JS variables inside those strings
- Can be in the same file as other JS or in separate files

# SWR 01

- Fetch + useEffect + useState is okayish, but we usually require complex features
  - E.g. polling, local caching, fetching on tab focus, request deduplication
  - We could implement this, but let's not reinvent the wheel ðŸ˜€
  - Enter: SWR (stale-while-revalidate)
- **Hooks based** HTTP client library

---


# SWR 02

- `yarn add swr`
  - Types are added out of the box
- Wrap your app in `SWRConfig` which accepts value of `SWRConfiguration` type
  - Fetcher callback needs to be defined
    - For all intents and purposes of this Academy just c/p my demo
  - Check out App.tsx in our demo project
- `const {data: match, error} = useSWR<MatchDetailsResponse>(matchRoute(matchId), {refreshInterval: 10000})`
  - Store result of MatchDetailsResponse type into match variable, error in error variable
  - Poll the server every 10 seconds

# Context motivation

- Problems:
  - We have a value at the top of the app, and need it:
    - A) Pretty much everywhere (e.g. app's theme - light or dark)
    - B) In some component deep in the file tree
  - We want to remain flexible where to use some data or logic
- Anti-solution: "prop drilling"
  - Pass everything via props to every component
    - The whole component tree re-renders on change, app is data heavy

---

# Context solution

- Shipped with React
- Wrap your components/App with a **ContextProvider** component with some value (can be an object)
- Consume your Context via ContextConsumer component or **useContext** hook
- See slide notes for detailed info

<Notes>

- Prop drilling - In React data is passed top-down via props.
  Prop drilling is anti-pattern when some components receive props they don't need and pass them to their children components and patterns repeats deeper into the tree.
- React Context allows developers to share data between a parent and multiple children. The parent is called `Provider` as it provides value for children.
  The child is called `Consumer` as it consumes provided data.
- Rules:
  - Provider has to be rendered above children (it has to be the parent to children)
  - Consumer will receive data from the nearest Provider of the same type (if multiple rendered).
  - When Provider value changes, all its Consumers will rerender, to get new value.
- Context works with both class and functional components. To be more specific context can be consumed in class and functional components.
- Context is created with `createContext` function. The function receives an optional defaultValue which will be used as the initial context value.
  The context contains two components (that are used from the outside):
  - Provider (`MyContext.Provider`)
  - Consumer (`MyContext.Consumer`)
- Contexts are usually added to separate files and they export `Context` itself, `Provider`, and `Consumer` components.

# Context vs Redux

- Redux is a 3rd party library for state-management
  - Extremely popular with React a few years ago, now it's just popular
  - Propagation of state changes to components
- Context comes out of the box with React
- Context is simpler to use and makes cleaner code
- Redux is more robust for state management and persisted states
  - Context can but isn't exactly intended to fully replace a state management library
