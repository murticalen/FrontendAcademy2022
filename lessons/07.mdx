# Responsive web 01

- Initially, web was desktop-only and then desktop-orientated, mobile was an afterthought
- Mobile browsers used to re-arrange web page flow to fit in on their screens
  - Not that bad but not great, browsers rendered the pages differently
  - Alternatives: special mobile sites which didn't need to be re-arranged (e.g. https://m.sofascore.com)
- Mobile phones started having "insane" resolutions, e.g. 5" phone was "Full HD" like 32" TV
  - Solution: viewport of those phones is smaller, **CSS pixel isn't the same as physical pixel**
- Viewport tag to add: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp
- More: https://webspeedtools.com/viewport-vs-screen-resolution-vs-dpr-vs-ppi/

# Responsive web 02 - Accessible web

- elements sizing: [different CSS units](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp) - absolute and relative
  - px (pixel) - absolute - CSS pixels
  - em - font-size relative to parent font-size; width, etc. relative to the font-size of the element
  - rem - relative to font-size of the root element (mostly to html tag)
    - If root element has relative font-size like `100%`, then it reads browser settings
- Which one to use? 3 combinations are mostly used:
  - 1) Sizing in px, font-size in px - Complex layouts like SofaScore web page
    - Because of that viewport tag, zooming-in pages makes them accessible
  - 2) Sizing in px, font-size in rem - Layout is fixed, content is browser-resizeable
  - 3) Sizing in rem, font-size in rem - Everything is browser-resizeable
    - Also works for complex layouts, but it's a bit harder

# `useMemo`

- Used to memoize **value** of some operation
- Memoize expensive operations
- No side effects allowed - use `useEffect` for side effects
- No guarantees that function will not rerun with same input
- `const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeSomething(a, b), [a, b]);`

---

import { UseMemo } from './07-files/UseMemo'

<Invert>

# `useMemo` - Example

<UseMemo />

</Invert>

---

# `useCallback`

- Used to memoize function (Not function result)
- Memoize handlers passed as props to avoid reference changes to handlers
  - Handlers - methods which handle events: onClick, onScroll, ...
  - Avoids unnecessary re-renders where the handler is passed as a prop
- `const callback = useCallback(() => { /* do something */ }, [ /* dependencies */ ])`
- `useCallback(fn, deps)` is equivalent to `useMemo(() => fn, deps)`

# React Refs

- React is declerative and abstracts DOM manipulations
- Refs are used to get reference on the underlying DOM element
  - Access DOM element properties (e.g. height, position, ...)
- Returns object with `current` key set to DOM object or `null`
- `useRef` hook - `const ref = useRef(null)`
- `createRef` method - `this.ref = createRef(null)`
- Refs are also used to store data which should not trigger re-renders
- Check out notes for detailed explanation

<Notes>

- React is declarative, it abstracts DOM elements and manipulations. Sometimes developers need access to underlying DOM elements.
- React Refs allows access to underlying DOM elements. Access to those elements allows developers to get element height, position, to add DOM attributes, ...
- Refs can be used in class components and functional components via the `useRef` hook.
- Ref will be returned in the object as `current` property. `current` property is a reference to DOM element or null if the element is not set.
- Refs can be used inside class components (`createRef`) or inside functional components (useRef`) hook.
- Refs are commonly used with generic base components (input, button).
- Refs are also used to store mutable data which should not trigger re-renders -> the same as the instance fields in classes

# React Performance

- Browser DOM is slow and inconsistent
- Reuse DOM
- SyntheticEvent - All DOM events in React are wrapped in the SyntheticEvent wrapper
  - Browser universal (works for all browsers) event wrapper
  - Has all properties of native browser event (`target`, `currentTarget`, `stopPropagation`, `preventDefault`, ...)
- Before React 17: Events were [pooled and reused](https://reactjs.org/docs/legacy-event-pooling.html), it caused problems for developers

---

# Virtual DOM

- Virtual representation of a UI in the memory
- Abstracts DOM manipulations, event handling
- Synced with real DOM -> **reconciliation** process

<Notes>

- React will make all changes and calculations on the efficient Virtual DOM. Once Virtual DOM is finished, React will calculate the difference with the real DOM to find a minimal set of changes needed.
- Virtual DOM is responsible for all DOM manipulations. It will also communicate DOM changes to the browser. All Virtual DOM tasks are performed under the hood by `reactDOM` library.
  `reactDOM` is the connection between `react` and browser (`react` is platform-agnostic, it will work in the browser, on mobile phones, on servers, anywhere where JS would work).
  Target platform is determined by wrapper library (`reactDOM` -> browser, server; `react-native` -> Mobile Apps)
- Reconciliation - process of syncing virtual and real DOM.

</Notes>

---

# Reconciliation algorithm

- Process of syncing Virtual and real DOM
- Assumptions:
  - Two elements of a different type will produce different trees.
    - Don't change element types when not needed
  - Developer can hint at which child elements are stable across renders (`key` prop)
- Determines component lifecycle (update, mount, unmount)

<Notes>

- Assumptions: If we change element type (div -> span) tree will be different and it should be replaced (remove old, insert new tree).
  Don't change element type if not necessary.
  Use the `key` prop to mark stable elements. Stable elements can be reused if the `key` stays the same.
  Don't change keys if not necessary and don't switch keys between two elements (especially of the same type, e.g. `div` ).
- If element rerenders -> update lifecycle will be called (`getDerivedStateFromProps`, `render`, `componentDidUpdate`), state is preserved.
- If element is removed and inserted -> unmount and mount lifecycles will be called (`componentWillUnmount`, `constructor`, `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `render`, `componentDidMount`), state is not preserved.
- [Reconciliation in details](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)

# Performance - Developers

- Minimize expensive DOM operations -> follow reconciliation rules
- **Minimize number of unnecessary rerenders**
- When will rerender happen:
  - Prop change - (prop value or reference)
  - State change
  - Context change
  - `this.forceUpdate()` - class components
  - When parent rerenders

<Notes>

- Avoid unnecessary expensive DOM operations (replacing elements).
- Rerenders can be slow (big lists, lot of elements, ...) and cause UX problems (flickering, mistimed animations, ...).
  React will try its best to preserve DOM structure, so rerenders could be cheap (if there are no DOM changes).
  Developers should know when components should rerender and how to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
  The component will rerender if:
  1. Props change -> Props with new value should rerender, props with new reference could avoid rerendering (if object reference changes, the object can still have same properties -> no need to rerender, use `useMemo` and `useCallback`).
     Just be cautious when diffing, as diff process can take longer than rerender.
  2. State change -> Few valid use-cases when state change doesn't need rerender. If state change doesn't need to rerender it's often a sign of bad state architecture (part of the state should be ordinary variable or a prop)
  3. Context change -> When context provider value changes, all consumers will be updated.
  4. When `this.forceUpdate()` called -> Used for complex multistep animations (could be replaced with carefully crafted state).
  5. When parent rerenders -> Common performance problem. When parent rerenders, all their children will also rerender, and those rerenders could be avoided.
     This problem is solved with component architecture: keep changes as deep in a tree as possible. Rerenders deeper in the tree will trigger fewer rerenders than those up the tree.
