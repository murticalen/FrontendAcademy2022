# CSS Box Model 01

- Each element is a box defined with `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`
  - `x` and `y` mark the top left edge of the box
  - `width` and `height` are applied to content part of the box
- **Content** can be distributed in the box with `padding`
- Box can be spaced form other boxes with `margin` (e.g. spacing between sibling elements)
  - Margins of adjacent elements don't stack!!! They collapse. Bigger wins.
    - https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/rules-of-margin-collapse/
  - can be negative - to place element closer - a bit hackish
- Box can be made visible with `border` - draws line on the edge of the box

# CSS Box Model - Ilustration

import boxModel from './images/boxModel.png'

<img className="big-image" src={boxModel} />

# CSS Box Model 02

- `box-sizing` property changes how browser calculates size of the element
  - default value is `content-box`, which includes only content
  - whether to border or padding included or excluded from the `width`
    - we at SofaScore use `box-sizing: border-box` -> includes content, padding and border

# CSS Display properties

- Display property is used to specify how should element behave in the parent element.
- Elements have default display properties defined in HTML specification
- Common display properties:
  - `block` - Element will take as much space as possible in the single row
    - no two block elements in the same row
    - e.g. `div`, `ul`, `main`, `p`
  - `inline` - Element will use minimal width needed
    - ignores width and height set
    - possible multiple elements in the same row
    - e.g. `span`, `b`
  - `inline-block` - inline element which doesn't ignore width and hight set
    - e.g. `img`
  - `none` - removes element from screen
  - `grid`, `table`, **`flex`**

---

# Flexbox - display: flex;

- Displays element as block level container - element will remain the same, children will be changed
- Applies flexible width (or height) and positioning to children
- Aligns children on defined axis (row, column)
- Children positioning can be specified (align all with start, center or end of the parent container)
- If children take more space then available - define wrapping
- If children take less space then available - define layout

# FlexBox Example

# Flexbox 02

- `gap` property is nice addition to organizing items via flex, especially in column
  - defines space between items so you don't have to use margins, also `row-gap` and `column-gap`
  - BUT: Safari supported it late and not many people update their Macs on time üò≠
    - https://caniuse.com/?search=gap
- more resources to learn flex:
  - [W3C - Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)
  - [Flexbox Froggy game](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

# CSS Position properties

- Type of positioning used for an element
- Used to define how should element be positioned based on its `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right`, properties
- `z-index` - tells browser how to display overlapping elements (higher number first)
  - default: first element on top
- Common position properties:
  - `static` - ignore position properties
    - default value
  - `relative` -> position element relative to element's normal position (`top`, `left`, ...)
    - stays in normal flow
  - `fixed` -> positions element relative to a screen (**not** content on the screen)
    - stays on the same place when page is scrolled
  - `absolute` -> positions element relative to nearest positioned ancestor 
    - positioned ancestor -> any element with position property different then `static` (default) !!!
    - common use with `relative` parent
    - removed from normal flow
  - `sticky` - positioning depends on scroll position, alternates between absolute and fixed

---

# CSS Transition properties

- Allow gradual/smooth transition between states, e.g. changing color, appearance, etc.
- There are many many librarires which do more than basic CSS transition
  - but basic CSS is faster üòÅ
  - we use [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/tutorials/) when tasked to do something more than basic CSS

# CSS Media

- Allow different style rules for different device capabilities (resolution, orientation)
- Responsive design -> different styles for different resolutions
- `@media screen and (min-width: 400px) { ...will apply styles only on screens wider than 400px }`
- Mobile first - write for smaller screens first and then handle wider devices
  - "Progressive Advancement" > "Graceful Degradation"
