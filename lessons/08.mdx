## React Patterns

---

# Controlled components

- Components which are controlled by the parent via props
  - They receive `value` and `onChange` handler
- Often used in forms to allow the parent to always know current input values

<Notes>

- Controlled components let their parent update their state. This is useful if the component state is also needed in the parent component (e.g. value of input element in form).

# Reusability & Separation

- The same logic can often be reused and separated into a single place
- Share logic between components
  - Separate logic and presentation in different places
  - Insert logic into the component from the other component (or function)
- React patterns (similar to Decorator Design pattern)
  - High Order Component
  - Render Props
  - Custom hooks

<Notes>

- Separation of concerns is an important principle in software development
- React allows us to insert logic into component via common React patterns (which are similar to the Decorator design pattern):
  - Hight Order Components(HOC)
  - Render Props
  - Custom hooks
- Decorator pattern is called that because it decorates some component with logic or behavior from the outside

</Notes>

# Motivation - Example

- Separate mobile devices from desktops

# High Order Component

- Function which receives component as an argument
- Returns new component which renders provided component with extra props
  - Function that wraps provided component into a new component with the desired logic
- Provided component must not be mutated
- Passes handler or value to the component via props
  - Problem when the passed prop is already in use by component (in `props`)
- Usually starts with `with*`

```react
const ComponentWithBehaviour = withBehaviour(Component => {
  // props for Component provided
  return function(props) {
    const behaviour /* value or function added to component */

    return <Component behaviour={behaviour} {...props} />
  }
})
```

<Notes>

- Function that wraps provided component into new component with desired logic.
- Component should not be mutated, it can only be decorated with new props.
- Note how `props` are spread on component provided. In props are own props for provided component.
  This is place where problems can happen if decorated prop has same name as some prop on component, as decorated prop would be overridden.
- HOC usualy have `with` prefix
- HOC are used in some popular libraries (`withRouter` in `react-router`)

</Notes>

# Render Prop

- Component without conventional render function
  - Receives render function as a prop
- Component with logic and without presentation
  - Calls provided render function with enhancements as arguments
- Render is often passed as `children` or as `render` prop

```react
// decorated component
function Component(props) {
  return <RenderPropComponent
    render={enhancements => /* do something with enhancements */}
  />
})
```

<Notes>

- Component with render method as a prop (render method is provided via `children` or `render` prop)
- More declarative usage than HOC, as it is used inside the component that is decorated, so prop name collision is not possible.
- Can substitute HOC and vice versa.
- Render Prop is used in some popular libraries (`render` prop in `react-router`, or `Downshift` in `downshift`)

</Notes>

---

<Invert>

# Render Prop - Example

---

# Custom Hook

- Function that is called inside functional components
  - Returns enhancements that will be used in functional components
- Uses other React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback` ...)

```react
// decorated component
function Component(props) {
  const enhancements = useCustomHook()

  return /* do something with enhancements */}
})
```

<Notes>

- Ordinary function that returns some enhancements and decorates component which called it
- Cleaner syntax, easier to understand

# React Portal

- Render children outside of DOM hierarchy
  - Used with modals, dialogs, notifications
- Commonly used with Singleton pattern
- ReactDOM specific
- `ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)`
- Event propagation and Context work as if it is still in the hierarchy

<Notes>

- Sometimes there is a use case to add some markup or component outside the DOM hierarchy.
  Those use cases often include modals, dialogs, app-level notifications and errors.
  It is used for components that pop out of layout (to avoid complex z-indexes)
- Singleton pattern is common as apps usually have only one element over others.
- Portal is in the `reactDOM` package, so it can be used only for web applications.
- `ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)` will render child (any viable child) into provided **DOM container**.
- Markup will be in container element but event propagation and context will behave based on hierarchy.
  For example, an event triggered in modal will propagate to the component that rendered Portal.
  The same rule applies to context, modal could consume providers that it could consume if it wasn't portal.

# Routing

---

# Routing

- URL addresses specific resource on the Internet (page, response, ...)
- Makes user navigation easier (refresh, browser back)
- Process of navigating to the specific resource on the web

<Notes>
  
- Routing can be defined as a mapping of an URL to the resource (website)
- Route (URL) is the identifier of resources on the Internet. The resource can be a website, API response, method, ...
- Routing makes users experience more satisfying, as users can refresh the page and end up on the same page, 
they can navigate through browser history (forward or back browser buttons), etc.
- Routing ensures that the same URL will always point to the same page (or another resource).

</Notes>

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

- Process of making a website more visible in search results
- Search engines crawl web, index content from pages, points to relevant pages in search results
- Ranking algorithm is secret, known only by search engine companies.

<Notes>
  
- Search engines (e.g. Google, Bing) crawl the web, following links between pages and indexing page content. 
This index is then used when user search for informations, as search engine can point to relevant page which is most likely to 
provide information to the user.
- Each search engine has its own secret ranking algorithm. but some parts overlap between them.
- SEO is important as it is directly connected with bigger traffic and revenue.

# Server side routing

- Route transition is handled on the server
  - When the URL changes, a new HTML document is retrieved from the server
- Browser has to communicate with the server
- Good:
  - Minimal data for each page
  - Search engine friendly
- Bad:
  - Slower interaction between pages
  - Full refresh of a page -> Context is lost

<Notes>
  
- Classic route transition strategy. When URL changes, the browser will request a new HTML document for the new URL. 
HTML is then parsed and any needed resources are fetched (CSS, JS, images, fonts, ...).
- Good:
  - Each page is a separate HTML document, so each page can contain minimal data needed for that page.
  - SEO benefits: Search engine crawlers are made to understand HTML markup, so they can better index each page, as it has its HTML.
- Bad:
  - Slower interaction as the browser has to wait for server response before switching pages.
  - Each route transition can be seen as a full refresh. 
  Previous page context (local variables, DOM) is lost and replaced with new page context. 
  There is also repetitive content on multiple pages (e.g. header is the same on two pages, but it has to be downloaded with each page and rendered again)

</Notes>

---

# Client side routing

- Route transition is handled on the client
  - When URL changes, new HTML is not needed
- Good:
  - Faster page transitions
  - Preserves context
  - Page transitions can be animated
- Bad:
  - Larger first load
  - Possible extra data
  - Not so friendly to search engines

<Notes>

- Route transitions are handled via JavaScript. This means that JS knows what to show for each URL, so there is no need to download a new HTML document.
- Good:
  - Faster page changes as there is no HTML document download included.
  - Preserves context as there is no full page refresh (variables are preserved, DOM can be preserved, ...).
  - Page transitions happen on the client-side, within the same document, so transitions can be animated to create a smooth user experience.
- Bad:
  - First-page load is larger as the whole app navigation has to be shipped to a client. Also, there is some extra code to handle routing which makes the load slower.
  - Possibly more than needed data could be sent, as all pages are sent at once.
    If the user quits the app without navigation to other pages, all those pages were downloaded without the real need.
  - SEO problems: search engines have to parse JS and create markup. They can do that but they can parse the page wrong.
