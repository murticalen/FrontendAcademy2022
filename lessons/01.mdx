## Frontend. Browser. HTML. CSS.

# Web application

- Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">link</a>
  - "A web application (or web app) is application software that runs on a web server"
  - "Web applications are accessed by the user through a web browser with an active network connection"
  - "These applications are programmed using a clientâ€“server modeled structure"
- Simply: it consists of **Frontend** (client) and **Backend** (server)

---

# Client - Server Architecture 01

import serverClient from './images/serverClient.png'

<img className="med-image" src={serverClient} />

- Core principle of web communication
  - Client asks the server for a resourse, server responds
    - Reource: HTML document, formatted data, image, video,...
    - E.g. What is the score in a match? Give me team logo...
  - THE protocol: **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
    - Later created: Websockets - to improve efficiency

---

# Frontend

- Interface with which a user (person or a script) interacts (sees, clicks, ...)
- "Visible" part of the web application
- In a general meaning - any client which has UI - Android, iOS, KaiOS apps
  - we use the term "Frontend" as a shorthand for web frontend

## Web frontend

- Visual application that is displayed by web browser
- Source written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Hopefully not in WebAssembly ðŸ˜±
    - Binary (compiled) [mostly JavaScript] for higher performance
    - https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/26/webassembly-by-hand.html

---

# Browser

- A tool to navigate the web, _display_ web applications and provide interactivity
  - core component: render engine
    - MSHTML, EdgeHTML - deprecated, used by Internet Explorer and early Edge
    - Gecko - Firefox
    - WebKit - Safari and early Chrome
    - Blink - Chromium project, fork of WebKit
      - Chrome, current Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Samsung Internet, ...
  - browsers work on CPU, but do mostly graphics tasks
    - hardware acceleration -> doing some tasks on GPU
  - market share: <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">link</a>

# Browser flow

import browserFlow from './images/browserFlow.png'

<img className="big-image" src={browserFlow} />

<Notes>

- Process starts when user enters URL to a web page / web application.
  - Browser need to locate IP address of a server (DNS lookup) to navigate user correctly
- Once user connects to the server, browser will automatically request server (via HTTP GET request) for `index.html` document.
- Browser then parses (reads) document and searches for additional documents needed for a page to be displayed correctly.
  - Those documents could be: CSS style sheets, JavaScript scripts, images, etc.
- All required documents will be requested by browser (again via HTTP GET requests).
- When browser has all resources needed it will start building the page. Browser used DOM (Document Object Model) to represet HTML structure.
  - Page building is 4 step process which is out of the scope of this lecture, but feel free to dig deeper if it sounds interesting.
    More information can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work#render).

# Browser differences

- Different engines -> differences in how everything works
  - most of things are standardized via W3C, but some browsers don't support some featured
    - <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_navigator_share">Can I use "navigator.share"?</a>
  - browsers depend on the OS
- Reporting bugs cheatsheet:
  - always report: browser, OS
  - can make a difference: ad-blocker, tracking protection, private or normal mode
    - also if 3rd party cookies are enabled or not
  - nice caveat: hardware acceleration
    - e.g. Chromium browsers and image scaling with hardware acceleration since version 80-sth

---

# HTML

- **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
  - HyperText -> text with references to other pages (links)
  - Markup -> standardized set of notations (tags and attributes)
    - e.g. XML, markdown (.md), TeX/LaTeX
  - Idea: **How to** display content
    - NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!!!! MARKUP LANGUAGE!!!
- Created by Tim Berners-Lee to enable document sharing (text based -> links, headings, paragraphs)
- Standardized by W3C
  - Latest and greatest: HTML5 - late 2000s, big improvements
    - Made propietary things such as Flash obsolete
  - <a href="https://morioh.com/p/6d422fc49bd2">HTML6 is coming</a>

# HTML Structure

- **HTML Element: Tag + Attribute(s) + Content**
  - Tag: identifies element (`html`, `body`, `b`, `div`, `span`)
    - opening: e.g. `<div>`
    - closing: `</div>`
    - self closing: `<img/>`
  - Attribute: specifies properties of an element (e.g. styling, source for an image, ...)
  - Content: between opening and closing tag
    - any text, HTML element, ...
    - self closing tags don't have content
- `<b>This is bold text</b>`
- `<div id="atribute_example">Text and/or other element(s)</div>`
- `<img src="path_to_image" alt="Text if image fails to load" />`
- Each HTML document has `html`, `body`, `head` tags.

---

# Semantic HTML

- The same content can be described in different ways
  - Write HTML in a way it conveys meaning when read, not just in browser

import semanticHtml from './images/semantic-html.jpg'

<img className="med-image" src={semanticHtml} />

---

# HTML Code sample

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>SofaScore Frontend Academy</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>Hello!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- **HTML relations:**
  - Parent - Child -> child is parent's content
  - Siblings - two elements with the same parent

# HTML Examples

# CSS

- **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets
- How HTML elements are displayed on device
- CSS3 specification
- `cssProperty: valueOfProperty;`
- `color: blue;`

<Notes>

- Cascading -> styles cascade (apply to lower levels) if not overridden
- Style Sheets -> suggests separate CSS file(s), but CSS could also be inline, or embedded in `style` tag
- `color` is property, `blue` is value, don't forget the semicolon (if omitted it would merge with next line and then both lines would be invalid and not applied)

</Notes>

# CSS Selectors

CSS defines styles and can be applied to single element, or to the group of elements

- Inline styling - for single element
  - `<p style="color:blue;">Text</p>`
- Style all elements with the same tag
  - `h2 { text-transform: uppercase; }`
- Style all elements with the same `class` attribute set to `className`
  - `.className { background-color: tomato; }`
- Style all elements with the same `id` attribute
  - `#uniqueId { text-align: center; }`
- Selectors can be mixed
  - `h2.specialHeading { padding: 8px; }`
  - `h2 .specialHeading { margin: 16px 8px; }`
- Universal selector (`*`), Grouping selector (`div, p { ... }`)
- Specificity: Inline style > Id Styling > Class styling > Tag styling

<Notes>

- Selecting tags could be useful for resetting default browser styling (i.e. `ul` elements)
- Classes are most common CSS selectors -> allow to style all elements with the same class. Same element can have multiple classes (e.g. `<div class="big blue rounded" />`)
- Id selectors are used sparingly. to style unique elements
- Id attributes should be unique for each element and should appear only once on each page.
  Plural form of the sentence is used because it would work on multiple elements with the same `id`, but this is an anti-pattern and should be avoided.
- Mixing selectors is useful when certain styles need to be applied only in specific context (e.g. styling inputs in forms differently)
- [CSS Specificity](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp)

# Adding CSS to HTML

- `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="myStyleSheet.css">`

- Embedded in `<style></style>` element

- Directly on element

- It is applied in order they are linked and order in the file in which they were defined

- Do separate HTML and CSS files!
