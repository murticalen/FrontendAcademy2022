# Homework 3 - SofaScore Frontend Academy

Homework 3 is simple. Pass all tests (Or as many as you can).

Tests are composed for you to explore some JavaScript nuances and to explore common syntax constructions that will be used in later lessons.

## Instructions

NOTE: You should only modify the `solutions.js` file, **do not modify** `solutions.test.js` file üòÄ

1. Copy `homework/03` directory to your git repository.

2. Position yourself (via terminal) into the copied folder. You will know you are in the right place if you can see `package.json` file with the name property `homework-03`.

3. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies 

([Jest](https://jestjs.io/)) is the best (personal opinion ‚ö†Ô∏è) JavaScript testing framework. It has a simple, out-of-the-box configuration and it is commonly used in JS and React ecosystems.

4. Modify `solutions.js` to pass tests.

Use `npm run test:watch` or `yarn test:watch` to run tests in watch mode. Watch mode will ensure that tests are re-run on every change made to solutions or tests (tests are fine, don't change them).

There is also `npm run test` or `yarn test` command available. This command will run tests and finish, so it should be manually re-run every time. I will use this command when reviewing your pull requests üòâ.

## Submitting Solutions

Similar to Homework 2, solutions should be submitted via your GitHub repository.

Open a new branch with Homework 3 in it. 

Create `.gitIgnore` file and add files that should not be pushed to GitHub, such as `node-modules` (directory with downloaded dependencies), `.DS_Store` (only on MacOS), debug logs (created when `npm` or `yarn` fails)... [More on `.gitIgnore` file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

When homework is finished open Pull Request and request my review.

## Extra Information

If you feel stuck, feel free to contact me for further explanation, some functions are maybe a little trickier than others, so don't beat yourself too much if you can't solve everything.
