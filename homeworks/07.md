# Homework 07

The task of your 7th homework is to peer review other people's 6th hw. You will be matched with two people based on semi-random pairing. The goal of the 6th homework was to practice writing React code with your current knowledge. In this homework, I urge you to review with constructive criticism and use it as an opportunity to learn. Look at how the app works, how the code is organized, which improvments would you add/suggest to make it better. Be a bit more detailed than I was reviewing your 4th homework, since React is the gist of this academy.

After all the peer review is completed, I will take a final look at your 6th homework solutions.

Deadline: May 17th, 0:00

Estimation: 1 - 4 hours
