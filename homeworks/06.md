# Homework 06

For your 6th homework you will create a quiz app similar to "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?". The app must ask a user 15 questions. The questions should be fetched from [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) API. Use their config helper to get the desired arhitecture. Or you can fetch 15 questions at the start of the game, in which case you just use this [URL](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=15) and forget about the config. You can show off your development skills and free time and fetch a new question, once a user correctly answers the previous one. Or take categories into account.

It must be a TypeScript React App. You must use styled components. You must fetch questions using SWR. Anything else is up to you. You can add lifelines, retreat, ANYTHING you WANT. If you have time.

Deadline: May 6th, 4PM
Estimation: 5 hours - 2 days
