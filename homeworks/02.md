# Homework 02

Your first programming homework is to create a form which takes 3 inputs: an email, a passwork and a text sentence. How it looks is up to you, but I encourage you to explore different styling, positioning, flex usages, etc.

In addition to the form, you are tasked to create a custom page logo using only html and css (e.g. div element with background and border radius will create a circle) or svg, if you know what svg is and how to add it.

# Requirements

All homeworks must be in the GitHub repository you have created for your first assignment. Each must be in its separate folder (naming e.g. hw02, homework2, ...). You must create a git branch for each homework, add your commits on that new branch, and once you have finished it, create a pull request and **add me as a reviewer**.

What is a pull request and how to create it:

- https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

Estimated duration: 3 hours - 2 days, depending on how complex you want to make it
