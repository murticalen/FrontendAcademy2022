# Homework 05

Your first React homework is very simple - you have to add some functionalities to (at least) two existing files "Input.jsx" and "Fetch.jsx". Both files specify inside them what the task is.

If you want to make the site as pretty as you can, that's up to you. Then you'll probably want to edit `App.css` file. Or add style properties directly to HTML elements. But don't worry too much, the point of this homework is to practice useState and useEffect (+fetch).

## Extra info

The project was created with `yarn` and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). When you clone this homework, position inside `05` directory and run `yarn`. That will install all packages from the internet.

Once you have done that, you can run `yarn start` inside the same directory and run the app. Once the app is running, adding changes will be visible in real-time, just like in the last lesson. With this homework, a linter is provided to help you finding bugs.

Check out README.md file in the same directory for more info.

Estimated duration: 3-4 hours for minimal effort
